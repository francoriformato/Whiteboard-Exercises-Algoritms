# Whiteboard-Exercises-Algoritms
A repository to store exercises done for Algorithms &amp; Data Structures course at UniPa and some personal exercises.

# C - Prog1
It contains two exercises written in C for UniPa's Computer Programming 1 course.

1) Puzzle:
Implement a puzzle game simulation program. We are supposed to have n tiles (n is a power of 2 and at least 32) that can be arranged on a square matrix. The game begins by asking the user to insert the n tiles chosen from three colors (or symbols). 
Then 1000 random arrays are generated using the same colors.
The 10 matrices most similar to that obtained with the cards chosen by the user are displayed.

2) Music Magazines
Simulate the automated management of a shelf of music magazines. 
It is assumed that you have a maximum of 10 types of magazines with their title, identification code, price, quantity in stock, the specific genre of the magazine (jazz, rock, pop, punk, ...) and the instruments treated (drums, guitar, trumpet ... up to a maximum of 5).
Allow the user to:
• Buy if possible a magazine given the name;
• Given a genre view all corresponding journals;
• Given a musical instrument view the magazines, in which it is entered, with the
cost and availability.

Plus, it was required to write a simple html file with a brief description about what has been done to develop the solutions.
